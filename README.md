# sklearn workshop
practical machine learning with Scikit-learn

## Introduction
scikit-learn is a machine learning package for python.
It contains many of the tools you need for data mining and data analysis.
It's built  on NumPy, SciPy and matplotlib. It focuses on using modern bayesian methods while avoiding classical inferential methods. Additionally, its ease-of-use and fast learning curve makes it an excellent package for whatever machine learning task you may have.

This workshop will focus on:
model selection, parameter tuning and feature selection.
